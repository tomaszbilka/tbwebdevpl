## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to your plain text in documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004. Main goal of this language syntax is to make it as readable as possible, even before rendering it. Idea is easy: you just put some special characters inside your text (for example: **# Heading One**) and you receive a special tag (**<h1>Heading One<h1/>**) after rendering whole text document. The questions is why use such tool as markdown when you can use some WYSIWYG editor like Notepad, Microsoft Word instead? So, there are answers:

- versatility – you can use markdown to write websites, documents, notes, books, presentations, emails and messages
- portable – files containing markdown-formatted text you can open by any application which supported that format
- independent – you can create Markdown-formatted text on any device running any operating system
- safe – even in the future, if application you are using stops working, you will still be able to read your documents because of readable syntax
- common – a lot of webpages support this language (all readmes in GitHub use Markdown).
- easy – it does not take long time to learn Markdown syntax

### How does it work?

When you write in Markdown, the text is stored in plaintext file that has an .md or .markdown extension. Next some application (like Dillinger) open your text and convert Markdown-formatted text to HMTL so it can be displayed in web browsers. Alternatively you can use this app to save the text in a different format (e.g. pdf).

### How looks Markdown syntax?

I use _Markdown_ to write posts in this blog. So if I want make **h1** tag, I just write:

> \# my title

**h2** tag is:

> \#\# my smaller title

| syntax      | result |
| ----------- | ------ |
| \# my title | a      |

and so on, the more hashes (\#), the smaller the title.

If you want to practice and see in real time result of your work, you can use one from many online applications to write in Markdown, like recommended by official Markdown documentation [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io/).
